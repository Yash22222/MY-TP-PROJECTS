Problem Statement:- 

• Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. • Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

• Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

• Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and Fl-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results
