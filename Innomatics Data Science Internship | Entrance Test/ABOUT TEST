Innomatics Data Science Internship | Entrance Test (Part 2 of 2) | Hackathon

Assume that you started working with Netfiz as a Junior Data Scientist. For your company, providing better movie recommendations is at its core and, 
helps improve better user experience and generate more revenue.

Understand that:-
Recommender systems make movie-watching a personalized adventure, delighting users with tailored suggestions based on their tastes. 
By predicting user preferences, these systems keep users engaged, driving increased interaction with your platform. A robust movie recommender system translates to business success.
